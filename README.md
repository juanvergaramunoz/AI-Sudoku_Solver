## Description

This project deals with an example of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. It was developed as part of the Udacity's "Aritifical Intelligence Nanodegree Program". **Please, avoid using this code as your solution if you are part of the program, as it will be detected as cheating!**

This project covers the Constraint Satisfaction procedures applied to a Sudoku problem. Apart from solving regular sudokus, it can deal with Diagonal Sudokus as well. Use the second parameter of the "solve" function to activate this mode!

The input to the "solve" function should be a list of each of the rows of the sudoku concatenated one after the other from top to bottom. Dots (.) are used to indicate an empty spot to be solved. The output given as a result is a dictionary where each row ranges from A to I (top to bottom), and each column from 1 to 9 (left to right).

    i.e: OUTPUT = {'A1': '1', 'A2': '5', ..., 'I9': '5'}

Lastly, this project has three main elements:

1) "SudokuFunctions.py" has the Constraint Satisfaction Functions

2) "ExtraFunctions.py" has additional functions: mainly related with plotting, and "string-to-dictionary" conversion of the Sudoku

3) "Sudoku_Example.ipynb" is a PYTHON NOTEBOOK that shows how to use the Sudoku solver

Again, avoid using this code as your solution if you are part of the Udacity program, as it will be detected as cheating!
